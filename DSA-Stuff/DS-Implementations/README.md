QueueImplementation:
    This is my implementation of the Queue data structure.

    I have utilized an interface for my class implementation, and I have also included a program that runs in the console and allows the user to manipulate a Queue using all the associated functions.

    Note: When using the program, put all the files into a singular folder for proper functionality and to avoid accessibility errors (class implements interface)

StackImplementation:
    This is my implementation of the Stack data structure.

    I have utilized an interface for my class implementation, and I have also included a program that runs in the console and allows the user to manipulate a Stack using all the associated functions.

    Note: When using the program, put all the files into a singular folder for proper functionality and to avoid accessibility errors 
    (class implements interface)


LinkedListImplementation:
    This is my implementation of the Linked List data structure. I have also included a program ('MainFile') that runs in the console and allows the user to manipulate a Linked List using all the associated functions.

    Note: When using the program, put all the files into a singular folder for proper functionality and to avoid accessibility errors 

BinarySearchTreeImplementation:
    This is my implementation of the Binary Tree data structure. I have utilized an interface for my class implementation, and I have also included a program ('MainFile') that runs in the console and allows the user to manipulate a Binary Tree using all the associated functions.

    Note: When using the program, put all the files into a singular folder for proper functionality and to avoid accessibility errors (class implements interface)

MaxHeapImplementation:
    This is my implementation of the Maximum Heap data structure.

    I have utilized an interface for my class implementation, and I have also included a program ('MainFile') that runs in the console and allows the user to manipulate a Maximum Heap using all the associated functions.

    Note: When using the program, put all the files into a singular folder for proper functionality and to avoid accessibility errors (class implements interface)

MapImplementation:
    This is my implementation of the Map data structure. I have utilized an interface for my class implementation.

    Note: When using the program, put all the files into a singular folder for proper functionality and to avoid accessibility errors (class implements interface)
