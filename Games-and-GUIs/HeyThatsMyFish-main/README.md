- Penguins are placed at the beginnig of the game on ice-flows(squares) with one fish by the players, alternately turns
- Each player's goal is to get as many fish as possible, reflected by the score
- Each player can select a penguin they desire to move with the cursor, and then move it by clicking on the desired spot
  - players can decide move a different penguin by reclicking currently selected penguin to deselect it
- Penguins with no possible moves are removed the from the board
  - Game ends when no more moves are possible by either sides (no penguins remain)
    - Winner is the player with the highest score (most fish collected)
