# Heap Display:
    Note: This program uses the JavaFX library, make sure it is downloaded and linked to your IDE properly for the program to function. 

    This is a JavaFX program, which is drawn to and played on a new window on the screen.

    This is another implementation of the Heap data structure but in a graphic/visual representation. I have utilized an interface for my class implementation. 

    This is a simple graphical program that displays the structure and values of a maximum heap up to size 16. The heap is drawn in a tree representation.
    - The user can interact with the heap by 
        -  adding values, by clicking on the number they want to add
        -  clicking the 'remove button' to remove a single element from the heap
