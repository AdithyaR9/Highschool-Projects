This is a program in which I have created an AI player for 4x4x4 Tic Tac Toe.

Note: My AI is within the 'Move' and 'Counts' files, with Move using Count to send the moves to the Client.

In order to lauch the program
  - 1. Run the 'ServerMain' File
  - 2. Simultaneously, without terminating 'ServerMain', run the 'ClientMain' File
  - 3. In the Console under the printed statement '-Test Type-', select option '1.' by typing 1 into the console and pressing the enter key
  - 4. In the Console under the printed statement '-Select an AI Category-', select option '0.' by typing 0 into the console and pressing the enter key
  - 5. In the Console under the printed statement '-Select an AI-', select option '0.' by typing 0 into the console and pressing the enter key
  
  - The Game will now play in a window on the top-left-hand corner of your screen
    - the console will display which AI is winning each round, switch the playing order and continue
    - the console will then display the final winner and the Win-Loss numbers
